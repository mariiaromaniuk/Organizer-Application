# Task Organizer Application  
The goal of the project was to create an application Task Organizer utilizing C++ and SQLite3. This application gathers data from user input, then creates a database and saves the data. All the data saved in the database and can be retrieved, modified, or deleted. Creating a database application in C++ is a daunting task. Although the actual code is quite simple, it is the configuration issues that make it an uphill battle. This makes it more intriguing, challenging, which tests your skills with every code you write. But, once you overcome the preliminary hurdles, there is nothing like C++.   

Although SQLite3 comes preinstalled on MAC OS it didnâ€™t work for some reason, so I had to download and install SQLite C source code, and a bundle of command-line tools for managing SQLite database files, including the command-line shell program, the sqldiff program, and the sqlite3_analyzer program. I also downloaded and installed DB Browser for SQLite and Qt Creator for GUI.
